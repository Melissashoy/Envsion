		<h1>How Technology Impacts Our Lives</h1>
			<p>Technology, are you familiar with this term? Well, surely you are. Technology surrounds our daily lives and affects every aspect of our movements. Naturally technology influences our ways of living and experiences. Just by simply taking a ride or using the computer for work we are already using technology. But how does technology positively and negatively impacts our lives? With this article you would be able to comprehend the importance and disadvantages of using technology.

The way that technology has impacted our society is significant for our growth and downfall. It has influenced the way we communicate and interact with one another and so as paved way for more ideas and opportunities worldwide. Because of technology, people from all around the world were able to connect together. Creating connections through online means and create friendships that would last for a lifetime. Although, those who lack access to the internet or digital media are at a disadvantage. This has caused increase in inequality.

Technology also significantly impacts the jobs that people take. Dominating the online market and creating jobs through online means. It has also caused efficiency and advantages for sellers. Although, this also removes the possible opportunities for job hunting due to automated machines. Leading to some people having a hard time providing their needs for their daily lives.

Overall, technology has a significant impact in all of our lives whether it affects us positively or negatively. We were able to advance and make life more convenient for living whether it be for us and the future generations. As technology continues to advance more opportunities will arise. We should also keep in mind how we use technology for us to benefit from it and not cause harm for humanity.</p>


<u><b>BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY</b></u>


<p>People nowadays cannot live without technology anymore. Their lives depends on it because they believe that it makes everything easier. Technology is very important in all areas of human life today and it has a lot of benefits that makes it useful.
Its first benefit is by giving us easy and quick communication. We can't always be with the people we love because we all have different lives. Even our families especially our parents needs to work or our friends that lives far from us, so we can't be with them that much. Before, it was hard to communicate with one another that takes too long to be delivered. However as technology improved, they developed smart phones computers, etc. that helps us with communicate to everyone inside and outside the country. It allows them to update each other even though they are not together.


Second benefit is that it helped in our daily lives by inventing technologies like washing machine that makes it easier to wash our clothes that does not require a lot of efforts anymore to make our clothes clean. Refrigerators that slows bacterial growth helped us to preserve our foods to maintain their natural, physical appearance and nutritive value. Television that gives entertainment and makes us updated by giving us news that happens around our world. Another benefits is in case of transportation. Transportation technology uses vehicles and infrastructure like railways and highways to support travel and covers movement via land, water, air and even space. Going everywhere around the world won't be that hard anymore because of invented modern transportation.

As a student, technology really gives us advantages that help us in our academics. One of the benefits of technology that I believe is very important nowadays is that it makes student's life easier by inventing the internet. Through the Internet, people can get and share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection. Apps like Google that can be used using an Internet connection help students to find information that is very useful for their studies. It can help them learn and know new things. Technology also improved education. With the help of digital simulations and models, teachers are not only able to prepare lessons in an efficient manner but also know the progress of their students. Using technology for academics create positive outcomes, enhances student learning, and increased social interactions. Technology indeed gives us a lot of benefits, just always remember to use it wisely to give us positive effects.</p>

 <u><b>DOWNSIDE</b></u>


<p>There are some downsides especially when it comes to using technology or internet in our daily lives. The information that the internet gives might not be precise or wholely factual. This can affect students, parents, workers, etc. Some people just rely technology to do their tasks for them. This can lead to bad habits and laziness. The people that surround them can be affected by the actions that they are doing.

People have to research thoroughly just to get factual information. The false information that the internet leads to the people believing the wrong side of things. This can also affect students especially when it comes to their research papers, project, or thesis. There are limited sources that can be trusted or is trusted by the people as of the moment. Some sites give false information especially because the people have access to the content it has. This leads to trolls changing the information of a certain topic.

This concludes that even though the internet or technology is very normal when it comes to our generation, there are still downsides or disadvantages. Some people have already been victims of the disadvantages technology has to give. People will always be affected by these. Although there are advantages, it is also given that there are always disadvantages.</p>

			<h3><p> <b>Adressing Inequality in Poverty Through Education</b></h3>
			
<p>Education is one of the factors that helps us to the road of success. It helps us individuals to learn skills and gain knowledge to be prepared to face the world and society. Although one of the most common problems that is often disregarded is the inequality of education in poor areas. Education helps us to our goal for a better career, the lack of quality and education can also greatly impact the knowledge needed to achieve this goals. In rural areas students tend to lack the equipment and materials needed for better quality education because of the lack of funding for the schools system. All around the world, poor areas tend to have little to no success to good quality education that leads to students being less likely to gain skills and knowledge necessary to climb up the economic ladder. If these areas were continue to have lacking resources for education, less and less opportunities will come in more problems arises. The cycle will continue and it will be harder for next generation. These are the 
most common problems that people in the society should acknowledge. It is our time to speak up and let our voices be heard on our journey to equality and dreams of opening doors for opportunities to everyone.</p>

		<b><h2>Mental Health Awareness</h2></b>

<p>Mental health awareness is about understanding how important it is to take care of our minds, just like we take care of our bodies. It's about knowing when someone is going through a tough time and how we can help them. It's also about not judging people who are struggling with their mental health and trying to be kind and understanding towards them. We also know that mental health issues are not something to be ashamed of, and we can work to stop people from being treated badly because of them. When we understand mental health. we can help to make the world a better, kinder place for everyone.</p>

		<b><h2>Teenage Pregnancy</b></h2>

<p>This is a common issue in our modern days. People think that it is normal. This should not be normalized especially if the parents cannot even take responsibility for the child. Parents should be financially, emotionally, and physically stable for them to take care of a child. Even if they can handle the pain, they should not continue, or in the  first place, don't do the deed if you are not ready for the consequences it may bring. Make sure that you can take responsibility for the risks that your actions may bring. Always think before you take the risk.</p>
